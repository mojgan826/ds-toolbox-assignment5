# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is useful in Git for checking the current state of a repository. It shows which files are staged, which files have been modified, and which files are not being tracked by Git.

Generally, it provides us with the following information:
- Which files are in the staging
- Which files are modified but not yet staged
- Which files are untracked by Git
- Which branch we are currently in

In JupyterLab, I can access similar information by using the Git extension (the git icon on the left sidebar). The status can be viewed in there, which will show files that are staged, modified, or untracked. It also shows current branch that we're in.
